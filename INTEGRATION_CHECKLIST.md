## Notes & Comments

### Important Reminders
- Always test on real devices
- Always check Firestore rules
- Always dispose controllers
- Always use const constructors
- Always handle errors gracefully

### Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to dispose AnimationControllers
- Not using const constructors
- Rebuilding entire screen on state change
- Not handling errors in async operations
- Not testing on real devices

### Best Practices
- Use DesignSystem for all styling
- Use ResponsiveHelper for layouts
- Use ValidatedTextField for forms
- Use page transitions for navigation
- Use NotificationService for notifications
