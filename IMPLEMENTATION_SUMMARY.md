## üé® Design System Usage Examples

### Using Colors
```dart
Container(
  color: DesignSystem.primary,
  child: Text(
    'Hello',
    style: DesignSystem.headlineLarge.copyWith(
      color: DesignSystem.textPrimary,
    ),
  ),
)
```

### Using Spacing
```dart
Padding(
  padding: EdgeInsets.all(DesignSystem.spacing4),
  child: Column(
    children: [
      Text('Title'),
      SizedBox(height: DesignSystem.spacing3),
      Text('Subtitle'),
    ],
  ),
)
```

### Using Responsive
```dart
if (ResponsiveHelper.isSmallScreen(context)) {
  // Small screen layout
} else if (ResponsiveHelper.isMediumScreen(context)) {
  // Medium screen layout
} else {
  // Large screen layout
}
```

### Using Animations
```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  SlidePageRoute(child: const MyScreen()),
)
```

## üêõ Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Notifications not appearing
**Solution**: Ensure Firestore rules allow access to notifications collection

### Issue: Animations are janky
**Solution**: Check for excessive rebuilds, use const constructors

### Issue: Form validation not working
**Solution**: Ensure validator function is provided to ValidatedTextField

### Issue: Responsive layout broken
**Solution**: Use ResponsiveHelper for breakpoint detection
